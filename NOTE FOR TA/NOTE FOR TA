Respected TA, 

Following are somethings that can help you my view my file well.

1. Plagiarism:
Certain codes were uploaded that prof taught in class. He also told to onspot search and find some codes. Hence, those are uploaded but I have mentioned in those codes if they are taken from internet or not. And understanding them have written new codes. Not aware of latter there was some delay so please excuse for that. 


2. Timeline:
All codes post midterm have been uploaded timely. codes for binary search, stress play etc were uploaded separately. Have just restructured them now. But have not removed old codes for you to verify the timings of the same. 

For linked list, the file got deleted. (you can check in history) some could be retrieved somenot, hence I just reuploaded all my linked lists files. Some TAs are aware of glitch as I had discussed in OH with them. 


3. Medical Note;
I was having severe allergy attacks 2 weeks pre and post break which delayed a lot of stuff for me. on the same grounda I had mid term extension. Please take into account while grading. 

Thankyou for your patience in reading this note.
