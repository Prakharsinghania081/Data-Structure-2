/* There are two cases for dynamic memory allocation. 


CASE 1: 
Number of elements in array < indices/memory allocated 
In this case, we are wasting the memory and we woll free the space not needed by elements. 

CASE 2: 
number of elements > memory allocation. 
Memory can take 9 indices, but we have 11 elements in aray to be entered. So now we need to increase the length. 


coding for case 1:
